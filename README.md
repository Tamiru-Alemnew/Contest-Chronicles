# 🏆 contest-chronicles

This repository is a collection of my live solutions to competitive programming problems from platforms like **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, **AtCoder**, and more. Each solution demonstrates various algorithmic techniques and problem-solving strategies developed during real-time contests.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

You'll find solutions to problems from:

- **Codeforces**
- **LeetCode**
- **AtCoder**
- **Other Competitive Programming Platforms**

## 📁 Repository Organization

All solutions are written in Python and named according to their problem codes from specific contests. Each file is prefixed with the problem's letter and name for quick reference.

### 🔖 Example File Naming

- `A_problemA.py` — Solution for Problem A
- `B_problemB.py` — Solution for Problem B
- `C_problemC.py` — Solution for Problem C

This naming pattern follows the alphabetical order of problems in contests, making it easier to locate specific solutions.

### 🛠️ CPH Helper File

This repository includes a **CPH (Competitive Programming Helper) file**. If you have the **CPH extension** installed in your code editor, you can use it to automatically test the solutions against the problem's sample input and output. The CPH file streamlines the testing process, ensuring your solutions are correct and efficient.

## 🐍 Language

All solutions are implemented in **Python**, utilizing its versatile syntax for tackling various algorithmic challenges.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions were crafted under the pressure of live contests. While they aim to solve the problems correctly, they may not always be fully optimized. They represent my thought process and strategy during the contests.

## 📘 How to Use

1. **Explore the Files**: Browse through the repository to find the solution to a specific problem.
2. **Run Locally**: Clone the repository and run the Python solutions on your machine.
3. **Test with CPH**: If you have the **CPH extension** installed, use the included CPH file to test the solutions against sample inputs and outputs automatically.
4. **Learn and Improve**: Use these solutions as a reference to enhance your problem-solving skills!
